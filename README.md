# Machine Learning with scikit-learn and pandas

Includes machine learning classifier and regressors.

## KNN_fruit_detection

This project demonstrates a simple **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier applied to a **fruit dataset**.
It shows how to use KNN for supervised classification, visualize decision boundaries, and evaluate model performance.

The project is based on an educational example from the *Applied Machine Learning with Python* course (Coursera), extended with clear plots and explanations.

### Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify fruits based on features (weight, height, width, color score, etc.)
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Steps:**
  1. Load the fruit dataset
  2. Split into training and test sets
  3. Standardize features
  4. Train a KNN classifier with different `k` values
  5. Visualize classification accuracy and decision boundaries
  6. Evaluate the model

### Dataset

The dataset contains fruit samples with the following attributes:

- Fruit label (apple, mandarin, orange, lemon)
- Features: height, width, mass, color score
